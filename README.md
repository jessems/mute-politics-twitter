# Mute Politics on Twitter

This is a resource intended to help you eliminate politics from your digital information diet. For now, I've only covered U.S. Politics on Twitter (and I'm unfortunately only just scratching the surface).

Blocking *all* politics is not something I necessarily advocate for everyone. It just so happens that I have 0 interest in the U.S. Political system but have found it difficult to abstain from it online, particularly around election season.

This is a work in progress. If you use the list of accounts or the list of words and something still slips through, quote retweet it and mention @MutePolitics to help me improve the approach. If you have suggestions for improvements you can tweet me directly at @jessems. Thanks!

## Instructions

There are 2 ways in which Twitter allows you to filter things from your feed. You can:

1. Block or mute an account e.g. @realDonaldTrump
2. You can mute a word e.g. "hillary"

These are two very crude ways to filter your feed, but unfortunately it's the only thing Twitter offers at the moment. As part of Mute Politics I've included some resources for both approaches.
